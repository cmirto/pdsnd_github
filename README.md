### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data


### Description
This project was based on analyzing Bikeshare data from three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
Based on the Python skills learned from Udacity, I created this project and submitted here on git hub.

You can input the city of your choice from the three cities above, and get statistics on the bikeshare data from that city.


### Files used
Files from the Python bikeshare project:
*  Bikeshare.py
* csv files for bikeshare data from new york city, chicago, washington (these are in the .gitgnore file)
